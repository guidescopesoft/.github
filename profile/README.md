## Hi there 👋

We're Guidescope, and we make software  :)

## Who we are 🙋‍♀️
Founded in 2026 by [@masonritchason](https://github.com/masonritchason), with help from [@JaredEspo](https://github.com/JaredEspo), Guidescope Software is dedicated to creating useful, unbloated, to-scale software tools for small businesses.

Our team got its start in 2025, when Mason and Jared worked together in the automotive industry, overhauling manual tasks and implenting cool new software. 
We went our separate ways but came together once more to start a new journey, applying this knowledge and experience to a new target: 

**any small business that would buy-in...**

## Contribution guidelines
Guidescope projects are intended to be closed for direct contribution (that's why the repos are private :])

We will make public postings if there is a need for open contributions. Keep your eyes peeled!
